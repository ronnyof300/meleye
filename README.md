# meleye
MelËye is derived from "Melanin" and "Eye" — a name that reflects our integrated approach to both skin and eye health. 
We created this platform specifically to address the bias in most AI systems that struggle to accurately detect conditions in people with darker skin tones. By focusing on the unique characteristics of African skin and eyes together, we're building technology that provides comprehensive health screening that truly serves everyone.


Our Mission

MelËye aims to make comprehensive health screening accessible to everyone across Africa. By leveraging artificial intelligence specifically trained on diverse skin tones and eye conditions common in African populations, we provide a unified tool that can help detect potential conditions early, empowering users to seek appropriate medical attention when needed.
How It Works

MelËye uses advanced AI algorithms optimized for African skin tones and eye characteristics to analyze images. Our integrated approach allows for comprehensive screening:

Upload a photo or take a picture using your device's camera
Our AI automatically determines whether it's examining skin or eye conditions
The system analyzes the image for potential signs of common conditions
Receive instant feedback with recommendations for both skin and eye health
Save your results for future reference and track changes over time
Integrated Approach

MelËye uniquely combines skin and eye condition detection in a single platform. This integrated approach is especially valuable because many systemic health issues can manifest in both the skin and eyes. By analyzing both, our system can provide more comprehensive health insights and detect patterns that might be missed when looking at either in isolation. This is particularly important for conditions like diabetes, autoimmune disorders, and nutritional deficiencies that can affect both skin and eye health.
Addressing AI Bias

Most medical AI systems are trained predominantly on lighter skin tones, leading to less accurate results for people with darker skin. MelËye is different. We've built our technology from the ground up to recognize and accurately analyze conditions across the full spectrum of African skin tones and eye characteristics. Our integrated approach ensures that users receive relevant and accurate health insights for both skin and eye conditions, regardless of their skin tone.
